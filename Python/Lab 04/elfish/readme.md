# Developing Bonus elfish

A word is considered elfish if it contains the letters e, l and f in it, in any order. For instance, we
would say that the following words are elfish tasteful, whiteleaf, unfriendly and waffles, because
they each contain those letters. Use the recursive function to implement this. Write one program
to call your recursive function and tell the user whether the input word is one elfish or not. HINT
You can recursively reduce the both the elfish letters and input word. The sample executions are
provided as follows

Note Your output should be in ONE line

Running example

CICT1002Lab4elfish python elfish.py waffles

waffles is one elfish word!

CICT1002Lab4elfish python elfish.py instance

instance is not an elfish word!
