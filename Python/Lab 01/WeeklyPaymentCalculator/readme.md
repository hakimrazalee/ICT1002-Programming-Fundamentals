# Weekly Payment Calculator

### Task Description

Develop one employee weekly payment calculation program. The
program requirement is as follows:
1. Allow users to run your program with three input arguments by passing three values to the
program: the number of working hours, input normal rate and input the overtime rate.
2. Your program will read the three arguments and calculate the users salary using the following two
formulas:
a. Payment of the normal hours = normal rate * normal hours
b. Payment of the overtime hours = overtime rate * overtime hours
NOTE: the working hours within 40 belong to normal hours and those beyond 40 hours are
considered as overtime hours.
3. After user inputs all the numbers, if the input numbers are invalid, you need to present an error
message “Your input is invalid!”. Otherwise, you need to print out the employee’s payment of
normal hours, his payment of overtime hours and total payment. The output payment requires
to have 2 precisions. For instance, if payment is 2300.456, it should print 2300.45. If payment is
2300, it should print 2300.00.

### NOTE: You have to strictly follow the input and output format.
Assume your program is named as WeeklyPaymentCalculator.py. 

Example output is as follows:

**C:\ICT1002\Lab1\Weekly Payment Calculator> python weeklyPaymentCalculator.py**

*20 30 100*

Normal Salary:600.00, Extra Salary:0.00, Total Salary:600.00

**C:\ICT1002\Lab1\Weekly Payment Calculator> python weeklyPaymentCalculator.py**

*60 30 200*

Normal Salary:1200.00, Extra Salary:4000.00, Total Salary:5200.00

**C:\ICT1002\Lab1\Weekly Payment Calculator> python weeklyPaymentCalculator.py**

*10000 10 200*

Your input is invalid!
